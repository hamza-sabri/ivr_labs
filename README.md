# ivr_labs

Mobile application (Android, IOs). 

ivr_labs is lab material viewers that help manage all kinds of materials related to labs like (Reports, Videos, lab documents, ... etc).

## Motivation

I graduated from PTUK as a **CSE** and had to take a lot of labs during that period which **sucked so much** because we had to take the same experiments over 
and over again and had to do reports for every single one of them. That was time-consuming and error-prone. 

We had to remember a lot of rules, if we missed one lecture and we make it up with the doctor then we are kinda scrood.

After taking a couple of labs I saw a pattern that repeats almost in all the labs we are having and I thought I could convert this pattern into an application.

At first, I didn't know what to build exactly I had a small idea in my mind to make the labs easier for me, but then I thought I can help others by asking them what would they like to have in such an app which resulted in the final image for the IVR_Labs application.

## Features

The point of this application is to help us students pass the labs with minimal effort so I included the features I thought would help achieve that goal and the features suggested to me:

* Support all Palestinian universities
* Each university is divided into multiple colleges to make the process of finding any lab easer
* Search bar
* PDF viewer for the reports & lab materials
* Video Player for the videos included with the experiments
* Download labs to browse them offline
* Contribute button to help increase the amount of data presented in the app (appears only for admins)
* Sharring reports
